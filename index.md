# Xin-Qiu Yao, Ph.D.

My research applies computational chemistry and bioinformatics to critical questions in biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology. My general approach is to develop and apply state-of-the-art computational techniques that can be coupled to experimental methods, and be predictive of a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including:

*	bioinformatic analyses to probe sequence-structure-function relationships
*	all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate essential conformational changes
*	enhanced sampling methods such as umbrella sampling and free energy perturbation for binding free energy calculations
*	Brownian dynamics for diffusional protein-protein and protein-ligand encounters
*	computer-aided drug design for discovering novel therapeutics
*	genome informatics for mapping SNPs and disease-associated variants to structural dynamic consequences and potential functional effects.

Currently, my research focuses on:
 
* Elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying systems for signal transduction (GPCRs, G proteins, arrestins, and GPCR kinases).
* Developing novel computational tools for the analysis of structural biological data.
* Predicting drug hypersensitivities and developing new approaches to drug discovery with improved safety and cost-effectiveness.
