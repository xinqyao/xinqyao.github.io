# Xin-Qiu Yao, Ph.D.

I am generally interested in the development and implementation of computational methods for understanding protein structural dynamics, function, and protein-ligand interactions. My current research focuses on:
 
* Allostery and activation mechanisms of protein systems for signal transduction (GPCR, G protein, arrestin, and GPCR kinase).
* Development of novel algorithms for tasks in Structural Bioinformatics.
* Prediction of drug hypersensitivity and improved approaches to drug discovery. 

See my [CV](/cv) for additional information.
